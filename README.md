## Project Description
This project involves tracking the population in regards of number of occupants in a building as well as the population flow. The goal is to locate and pinpoint occupants’ positions and thus aviod unnecessary energy usage in electricity, lighting, etc. The system was tested at 41 Cooper Square and will be extended to train station as a larger application.

This has been done by collecting data about WiFi MAC Addresses, Bluetooth addresses, video and picture captured by attached cameras. The information about humidity, temperature, and ambient lighting level is also collected for data visualization as well as application of energy saving. Through the wireless sensor network, data warehousing and the friendly visualization, we presented a fully functionable and general-purpose IoT system.
 
***A more advanced version has been built, but reserved for proprietary rights.*** More info could be found at publications listed above.
