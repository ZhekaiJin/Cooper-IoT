## IOT system acquire population data and environment parameters


### This project involves tracking the population in regards of number of occupants in a building as well as the population flow. The goal is to locate and pinpoint occupantsâ€™ position and the test is firstly conducted in cooper and will be extended to train station as a larger application. This has been done by collecting data about WiFi MAC Addresses, Bluetooth addresses, video and picture captured by attached cameras. The information about humidity, temperature, and ambient lighting level is also collected for data visualization as well as later application of energy saving. Through the sensor system, back-end processing and front-end visualization, this project demonstrated a fully functionable and a complete Internet-of-Things system.
